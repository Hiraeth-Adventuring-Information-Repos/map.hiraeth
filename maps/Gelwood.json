  "blurb": "Located on the southern side of the Ardoise Mountains and just off the old Chemin de Ronceval (Ronceval Road), Gelwood is a town defined by resilience. This revived frontier settlement is built upon the moss-covered stone foundations of a much older, forgotten settlement. In the last handful of years, hardy settlers from Rockdrift and Ironstream have begun to reclaim the ruins, building their homes and livelihoods amidst the ghosts of the past. It is now a burgeoning community of farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and ambitious prospectors, all drawn by persistent tales of gold, platinum, and even diamonds hidden in the nearby mountains.",

      "description": "Run by Barthan Ironhand, a retired dwarven prospector with a kindly smile and hands like worn stone, this shop is the heart of Gelwood's commerce. The air within smells of sawdust, cured leather, and pickling spices. Barthan's stocks everything a settler could need, from sturdy axes and mining equipment to bolts of wool cloth, dried rations, and medicinal herbs. He is a font of local knowledge and is always willing to share a bit of news or a useful rumor with his customers.",

The orchard miraculously survived the downfall of the previous settlement and was reclaimed from the wild by the family. They cultivate exceptionally crisp, tart apples and produce a famously potent cider that is a favorite at the Sleeping Giant tavern. The grove is known for its serene, almost unnaturally peaceful atmosphere.",

The shrine is quietly maintained by an elderly woman named Lena, who ensures that all gods, great and small, are shown their due respect.",
