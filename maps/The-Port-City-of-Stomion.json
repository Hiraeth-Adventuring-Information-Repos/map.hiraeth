Fed by the city's only remaining natural spring, the water is naturally warm and famed for its revitalizing properties. The interior is a humidity-filled paradise where exotic flora—blessed by the influence of Veridia—thrives under skylights and soft candlelight, defying the harsh industrial climate outside. A breathtaking statue of Pythia stands at the center of the main pool, her arms outstretched as if offering the waters to the bathers below.Operated by the Lifewardens and a quiet staff of attendants, the facility maintains a strict policy of equality; within these walls, nobles and merchants bathe side-by-side without segregation, weapons, or rank, though the clientele remains largely exclusive due to its location. Silence is heavily encouraged, allowing the sound of trickling water to dominate the air. High Warden Thyleesha currently manages the baths, though she grows increasingly anxious as recent industrial run-off from the neighboring districts threatens to taint the ancient, mysterious source of their holy spring.",

Verrick is a 'Sanitized Tyrant' who views the occupation not as a war, but as a failing factory requiring correction; he wears pristine white gloves to metaphorically and literally keep the filth of the city at bay. The interior is chillingly cold and decorated with imposing propaganda of the Emperor. While the upper floors are a maze of dismissively polite bureaucracy where meetings are nearly impossible to secure, the lower levels house the Directorate's interrogation cells. It is guarded by a specialized detachment of the City Watch, ensuring that Verrick's industrial dismantling of the rebellion proceeds without interruption.",

They are famous for serving high-quality meals at unbeatable prices, a feat accomplished by the sisters personally scouring the markets at dawn to source fresh ingredients themselves.

We stripped the layout and partitioned it into flats to house a crew of makers and their families. The main floor got squeezed, but it remains the beating heart of the operation: a high-traffic, communal fabrication zone where every discipline from leather-working to cold forging collides. We keep a resident fabricator on site, bunked in a solo unit. They machine the components, true the grinding wheels, and repair the communal gear. In exchange for keeping the shop running, the rest of the crew knows when to look the other way. If a shipment of non-standard, unregistered materials hits the loading dock? We didn't see a thing. The heat is high, and the quarters are tight. We don't act loud; we just hammer hard.",

Maintenance is a magical affair, with three head lawnkeepers commanding a small army of unseen servants to keep every blade of grass in place, while second-year students are tasked with lighting the district's magical lamps as dusk falls. Despite its open gates and public accessibility, the Gardens maintain a strict standard of order, enforced by nightly sweeps that ensure no vagrants linger after dark. While the surface is a haven of learning and recreation, the river water—though safe to drink—has begun to taste foul. Rumors persist that the pristine grounds hide a darker purpose: a dangerous subterranean complex known as The Deeproot.",

While the dragon's bones are dismissed as myth, the slayer's legendary weapon is rumored to still exist, hidden in plain sight within the castle's halls, unrecognized by its current occupants. The current Governor, a weak-willed administrator who placates the occupying forces, rules from an office that overlooks the city rather than the sea. This dominance is visually reinforced by a Melanoptera, a black Beccin airship that hovers perpetually over the castle spires. The grounds are patrolled by the 'Black Guard,' elite Beccin VIP soldiers who watch over the mixed staff of locals and imperial ambassadors, while prisoners rot in the dungeons below.",

      "description": "Perched at the extreme downriver tip of Stomion, Brighttfyr is a blinding sanctuary of glass and stone dedicated to the illumination of the world. Named after the legendary priest who sealed a gate to the Shadowfell five centuries ago, the district is dominated by the High Beacon—a massive, non-magical oil lamp whose brilliance pierces the night and guides sailors through the treacherous mouth of the river. The area is a rhythmic duality of worship; the Beacon House serves Origin, God of the Northern Star, while a smaller, embedded temple serves Bethtox, the Sun God. Life here revolves around the 'Changing of the Light,' a ceaseless cycle of four liturgical shifts—morning, afternoon, evening, and night—ensuring the district is humming with activity long after the rest of the city sleeps. Clerics live in austere, communal office-quarters, seemingly ignoring the politics of the occupying Beccin Empire in favor of their eternal duties. While the public is welcome to walk the bright, salt-sprayed streets or seek anti-undead rites from the priests of Bethtox, rumors persist of ancient, secret tunnels beneath the rock—defensive passages designed to keep the lamp lit even if the city falls to war or darkness.",

Sturdy stone buildings, such as the Iron Coffers' Hall, line impeccably clean streets that are almost entirely devoid of residential life, emptying out completely into a silent stone canyon at night. This district operates as a semi-autonomous zone with its own strict laws and private security force; flashy but formidable guards in heavy plate armor enforce a rigorous dress code, barring entry to vagrants and anyone without explicit business.

      "description": "Connected to the city by a long, defensible stone bridge, Harrowholm is a small, fortified island that serves as the seat of Stomion’s municipal government. The district is named for 'The Harrowing,' a tragic historical event where the city's ancient noble family sacrificed themselves to seal a gate to the Shadowfell—an act that infused their surviving bloodline with latent sorcerous power. The island is dominated by a distinctive round tower which houses the headquarters of the City Watch on its lower levels, while the upper levels serve as the residence for the current Mayor, Thaddeus Vane, and his family. Mayor Vane is widely regarded as a weak leader who works far too comfortably with the Beccin occupiers, creating a local government that operates autonomously in name only. He rules with a small circle of appointed officials, protected from the tax-paying populace that elected him by the surrounding waters and the City Watch barracks beneath his floorboards. Rumors persist among the guards that the island is haunted by the shadows of the original noble sacrifice, and deep beneath the tower lies a dungeon that holds more than just common criminals.",

This area is kept unnervingly clean—a 'model district' designed to showcase the might of the Ossurian Forges to the occupied populace. The skyline is dominated by The High Hammer of Matrix, a temple dedicated to the God of the Forge and Destiny who liberated the dwarves from their ancient oppressor. The temple is marked by a colossal, ornamental hammer suspended above its entrance, a symbol of the destiny forged within. The streets are lined with the high-end showrooms of the Beccin Empire's military industrial complex, displaying gleaning weapons and marvels. While these storefronts are open to the public, the workshops behind them are restricted zones. The district is primarily inhabited by Dwarves—both Ossurian expats and local artisans. It is also the location of the 'Old Furnace.'",

The district centers on the titular 'Old Fort,' a weathered stone structure that once defended the coast but now serves as the weary heart of municipal administration. However, it is the Beccin Embassy that truly dominates the skyline; a massive, modern structure of red brick and glass that has been annexed onto the ancient fort, nearly eclipsing it in size and standing as a physical manifestation of the occupation. During the day, the streets are a chaotic sea of misery and opportunism: long, snaking lines of citizens wait hours to pay the 'Math Tax' or plead for permits, while 'fixers,' scribes, and disbarred lawyers buzz through the crowds selling shortcuts. The air is thick with the smell of ink, despair, and ozone. Yet, the moment the clock strikes 4:30 PM, the district dies instantly. The shutters slam down, the bureaucrats flee, and Oldfort becomes a ghost town of silent stone and ticking clocks.",

The air here is thick with smog and strange, unnaturally colored chemical vapors that swirl under the light of sickly yellow oil lamps, which burn day and night to cut through the haze. It serves as the component heart of the city's production, churning out gears, rivets, and refined fuel to feed the factories elsewhere. Unlike the state-run facilities, the Steamwall is privately held—the Beccin Empire explicitly owns nothing here, leaving the district in the hands of ruthlessly efficient private consortiums. It is a district of pure utility; the smell of copper and metal hangs heavy, and while the noise of grinding machinery is deafening by day, the area empties completely at night, as no one is willing to live amidst the toxic fumes.",

It is a district of families as much as soldiers, filled with the bustling domestic life of those on the empire's payroll. The streets are washed in the colors of the Empire, draped heavily in flags and patriotic propaganda to keep morale high. The district's most envied features are its exclusive commissaries—well-stocked stores that offer goods and luxuries often unavailable or unaffordable to the general public.

Despite the name, no defensive gate stands here; the title is a legacy of the ancient wind chimes that once hung from every eave and archway 'back in the day.' A handful of these original chimes remain, filling the plaza with a soft, melodic background music that encourages hushed tones and polite behavior. This is a district of high-end commerce where the streets are uncrowded and the atmosphere is undeniably snobbish; one does not simply 'shop' at Chimgate, one selects fine jewelry, clothes, and art from masters of the craft. The clientele is a mix of wealthy tourists, established merchants, and high-ranking Beccin occupiers seeking to acquire local luxury. Deals are frequently finalized over delicate infusions at The Azure Teapot, the district's premier tea house.",

It is a district of soaring stone spires connected by elegant sky-bridges, allowing residents to traverse the area without ever touching the ground level. The atmosphere is distinct from the rest of the city; bathed in the cold, steady glow of blue-white magical arc lamps, it stands in sharp contrast to the flickering yellow gaslights of the Beccin occupation. Access is strictly controlled through a combination of physical checkpoints and magical ward-alarms that alert private security to unauthorized entrants; those caught without proper paperwork are stripped of their possessions and ejected. Inside, the Beccin presence is almost non-existent, leaving the powerful Great Houses to plot, dine in high-end bakeries, and flaunt the latest fashions in relative sovereignty. While the spires represent the height of luxury, the foundations are rumored to be honeycombed with ancient crypts holding the secrets—and remains—of a first sorcerers.",
