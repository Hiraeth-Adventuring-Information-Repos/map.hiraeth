Now the land is a twisted reflection of its master's tormented soul: the sun is a stranger, the forests have grown teeth, and the entire valley is caged in a ghostly mist—a monument not to a kingdom, but to one man's tragic and eternal damnation.",

For generations, this fertile breadbasket was a disconnected patchwork of independent nations. This changed when the pragmatic gnomes of Blū, seeking a more efficient and stable trading partner, brokered a grand unification - this caused a short and violent civil war. By offering infrastructure investments and access to advanced technology, they helped organize them into a cohesive republic. The name 'Farnear' was chosen by the new council to signify their new reality: no longer a 'far'-flung collection of nations, but a single, 'near' neighbor, united in prosperity.",

Her subjects enjoy a security few other nations know; the Empress's iron will shields them from foreign threats and ensures the orderly function of the state. She is their protector and their provider. Yet, she is also their greatest source of fear. Her sanity is a tempest, and a sudden bout of madness can turn a minor offense into a capital crime, unleashing the terrifying wrath that gives the nation its name. The people of the Iron Bash offer their Empress both genuine gratitude and cautious obedience, ever-watchful for the signs of an approaching storm.",

They hold a weary suspicion of the elves since an incident involving a destroyed caffeine-fungus, but this pales before their outright hatred for the Athenaeum, who once turned the dwarven lands into a battleground for a human war the dwarves neither wanted nor cared for.",

        "description": "While newer nations practice agriculture on an industrial scale, the ancient kingdom of RosWin is the continent's traditional, gourmet heartland. Its name is believed to be a corruption of an old phrase for 'Red Wine,' hinting at the rolling, sun-drenched hills of vineyards that define its landscape. Here, heritage and quality are valued over mere quantity; power lies not in armies, but in the unique terroir of the soil and the prestige of a family's ancient vintage. Governed by noble houses whose passionate rivalries over their harvests are legendary, RosWin has long survived as a political crossroads, a neutral ground where treaties are often sealed over a bottle of its finest wine.",

Under the watchful eyes of imperial legions, a populace of convicts, debtors, and conscripts toils to strip the land of its rare minerals. The entire operation is the personal fiefdom of the Emperor's apprentice Legate Crassus, a notoriously avaricious governor who measures the value of a mountain in ore and the value of a person in the labor they can provide to the imperial coffers.",

From its grim citadels, the Duke orchestrates a vast network of spies, while its remote location makes it the perfect site for the Empire's most secret and forbidden magical research.

The dwarves were not destroyed for their gold, but for the sacrilege of disturbing the hallowed bones within. The dragons of today continue their war not just for treasure, but for the instinctual right to claim the mountain as their final roost.",
